# D-MAP Localizer Using ICP

This is the implementation of the final project for the **Robot Programming 2023/2024** course at **Sapienza University of Rome**. The project is developed using **ROS 2 Humble** and **C++** on **Ubuntu 22.04**.

## Overview

In this project, I have implemented a Distance Map-based localizer using the ICP algorithm. To test the localizer, I cloned and modified the **Turtlebot3 fake node** from the **turtlebot3_simulations (ros2-devel branch)** ROS package.

## Features

- Added a simple 360Â° laser scanner to the Turtlebot3 fake node.
- Modified the Turtlebot3 fake node's velocity command callback to support collisions with obstacles.
- The **dmap_localization** package contains an executable called **dmap_localization_node**, which performs the localization task.
- The **dmap_localization_node** subscribes to the */map*, */odom*, */scan*, and */initialpose* topics.
- The localization node constructs a distance map when it receives a grid map from the */map* topic. It then waits until it receives an initial pose from the */initialpose* topic. Afterward, the localization process starts by listening to the */scan* and */odom* topics.
- The localization node publishes the estimated *map -> odom* transformation using *TransformBroadcaster*. It also publishes the estimated pose of the robot on the */localization_pose* topic for visualization purposes.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- ROS 2 Humble
- C++ compiler
- The following ROS packages:
  - turtlebot3
  - turtlebot3_msgs
  - navigation2

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone git@github.com:mosix11/Robot-Programming-Final-Project.git
    ```

2. Install dependencies:

    ```bash
    sudo apt install ros2-humble-turtlebot3* ros2-humble-navigation2
    ```

3. Source ROS Humble:

    ```bash
    source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash
    ```

4. Build the project:

    ```bash
    cd Robot-Programming-Final-Project/
    colcon build
    ```

5. Set up the environment with the following commands (you have to do this in 2 separate terminal instances):

    ```bash
    source install/setup.bash
    export TURTLEBOT3_MODEL=burger
    ```

6. Run the localizer node:

    ```bash
    ros2 run dmap_localization dmap_localization_node
    ```

7. Run the simulation node in another terminal instance:

    ```bash
    ros2 launch launch/program_launch.py
    ```

8. Add the */localization_pose* topic to the RViz simulation window. Then publish a pose using "2D Pose Estimate."
9. Run the *teleoperation* node from **turtlebot3** using the following command:

    ```bash
    ros2 run turtlebot3_teleop teleop_keyboard
    ```

10. Start driving the robot!
